# WEEK2 Report
#### Project: A Reference Model of Applying IoT (Internet of Things) and Blockchain to Enterprise System 
#### Meetings Recap:  
- Wednesday 4pm - 5pm: meet up with Hamid, group assignment report progress
- Saturday 10am - 4pm: slack, gitlab build; group discussion, cooperation – learn to use react + redux + react router + material UI starter; blockchain platform decision 
– Ethereum, a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts on a custom built blockchain

#### Week2 task:
- Complete modern react with redux learning;
- Project detailed architecture Discussion;
- Division of proposal

#### Personal responsibility of proposal assigned: 
- After discussion with team members, write down the background story for this project
- Create the necessary charts for illustration
- Share to ../project_assignments/proposal or a .gdoc file for members to review

- Search for articles analysing current drawbacks and benefits of applying blockchain data visualisation in logistics industry
- Upload revised papers or any relevant files to ../project_assignments/proposal/literature_review/data_visualisation for members to review
- Write down the background analysis for blockchain data visualisation

> #### Redux basics  
> **Actions** are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. You send them to the store using store.dispatch().Actions are plain JavaScript objects. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed. Types should typically be defined as string constants.  
> The **reducer** is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state. `(previousState, action) => newState` It's called a reducer because it's the type of function you would pass to Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue)  
> **Store** is the object that brings them together. The store has the following responsibilities:
> - Holds application state;
> - Allows access to state via getState();
> - Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);
> - Registers listeners via subscribe(listener);
> - Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).

>  **SSR-react server-side rendering** The initial content is generated on the server, so your browser can download a page with HTML content already in place. Updates to the content are still handled in the browser.
> - SEO - Rendering server-side helps search engine crawlers find your content, but sometimes Google can find your content without SSR.  
> - Performance - After the browser downloads HTML & CSS, it can display your rendered components to the user without waiting for JavaScript to download or React to render; SSR is more work for your server, so your HTTP response will take a little longer to return. A lot longer if your servers are under heavy load.
> - Complexity - Node support: Your React components will need to run on node. Check if window and other browser-specific APIs exist before using them. Two routers: If you use react-router on the client side, you'll need to rewrite those same routes on your server. APIs: If your React components make requests to your API, these requests may need to behave differently when they run on the server, perhaps by directly querying your database or other application logic.
