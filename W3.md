#### Background story draft-  
It seems that counterfeit sales worldwide have been a serious issue and no supply chain is impermeable. Fake products crop up in everything from clothing, handbags and perfumes to food and drugs. According to the OECD and the EU’s Intellectual Property Office, ‘imports of counterfeit and pirated goods are worth nearly half a trillion dollars a year, or around 2.5% of global imports, with US, Italian and French brands the hardest hit.’ [1] Counterfeiting also have negative influence that endanger lives – fake pharmaceuticals that result in treatment failure or even death, baby formula that harm infants and counterfeit makeup that lead to led to severe allergic reactions. Fake and contaminated milk powder killed dozens of Chinese babies in 2004 and left almost 30,000[2] sick in 2008.

However, in that case, the onslaught of fake baby formula in recent years is staggering in scale. In March 2016, 6 arrests have been made over the alleged production and sale of fake milk powder and the gang sold more than 17,000 cans, earning nearly 2 million yuan (S$419,524) [3].  In October 2016, 19 people have been arrested in Shanghai for trying to sell nearly 300 tonnes of expired milk powder, and about 166.8 tonnes of the products were sold through wholesalers and online shops [4].

Any commodity is facing a problem of traceability. From food safety to authentication of goods, if we can solve the problem of traceability, things will work out fine. In traditional supply chain industry, the problems like parcel loss, miss or wrong delivery, even the package midway changed can often be found. And the basic way to solve this problem is to give each package a unique “ID”, record and monitor production, transport, sale and all aspects to ensure safety, and all people involved in the supply chain can record and track the transactions, which is primary intention of our system. 

We try to apply private blockchain to enterprise system for an e-commerce platform with integration of value chain. Blockchain as a distributed tamperproof ledger can be used to store the transaction information collected from geo-distributed IoT devices, which speed up security settlements and insurance processes. With the features of transparency and immutability, blockchain is an ideal platform to store data, which can greatly reduce time delays due to manual intervention and human mistakes. It can also solve the problem to verify authenticity or fair trade status or products by tracking them from their origin. 



#### Literature review – blockchain visualization

Blockchain is a append-only data structure that can be viewed as a large directed acyclic graph [6], where each blocks contains multiple transactions. Blockbench is visual evaluation framework with which different blockchain systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Workloads like key-value storage and CPUHeavy are designed to target the four abstraction layers – consensus layer, data model layer, execution engine layer, application layer. It is an effective way to assess viability and performance by benchmarking these layers. For example, Ethereum can take advantage of multi-core CPUs and large memory to improve contract execution and I/O performance [5]. And we choose Ethereum as back-end system because it is more mature in usability compared to others.

Data visualization can also be used in blockchain for tracking network status and transaction flows. However, there is a clear lack of systemic visualization tools. 


#### User story draft:
The system is designed for e-commerce platform with integration of value chain, which directly purchases goods to sell, and built own logistics, forming a completely commercial closed-loop. The fragmentation of transaction data, the diversification of transaction nodes and the complication of transaction network are the main characteristics of the traditional retail industry. The collection, storage and integration of information such as production, circulation, delivery of products is the core proposition of end-to-end retail supply chain management, while the credibility, reliability and record of information during the whole process would be the concern of customers, regulators and e-commerce platforms.

The user of the system can be any people involved in supply chain from procurement to logistics.
- As a supplier, I want to track and monitor the detailed information of products during transportation process, so that I can monitor costs, labor or waste in emissions at every point of supply chain.
- As a supplier, I want to edit and update the properties of goods by a back-end management system.
- As a supplier, I want to edit the user profile by a back-end management system.
- As a customs officer, forwarding agent or any people involved who deliver the products, I can scan the code of the product so the information can be recorded in the blockchain database system.
- As a service team of e-commerce platform, I want to monitor the products easily at each stage so that I can make rapid and accurate investigation if there is an accident.
- As a customer of e-commerce platform, I want to see the origin place, circulation history of goods and so that I can check the authenticity of products.
